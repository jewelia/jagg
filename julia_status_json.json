When I was at IBM Research, my commute for the first few yrs was 15-20min by car, which wasn't too bad (not much traffic) and there are trails near IBM where I could run after work. Then I moved to Mtn View, and IBM was 45min by car, which was rough but I worked from home a few days/week. After IBM I went to a startup in SF where I commuted 1 hour by train followed by 10 min walk from station to office. At first it wasn't so bad (CalTrain is really nice) but I couldn't run after work b/c I was spending all my time commuting & there are no nice running trails around SOMA. My quality of life/happiness significantly dropped. Now I commute 2 miles (!!) by bike, work 1/2 a mile from running trails and have, by far, the best quality of life, and I'm much more productive.", "height": "", "source": "", "link": "", "type": "facebook"}], [1339554133000, {"width": "", "data": "Julia Grace posted a link to Matthew Caselli's timeline.", "height": "", "source": "", "link": "", "type": "facebook"}], [1339554370000, {"width": "", "data": "\"Hi Beth, the yoga studio I...\" on Beth Jaworski's Wall.", "height": "", "source": "", "link": "", "type": "facebook"}], [1339554686000, {"width": "", "data": "\"Great job Mackenzie Israel-Trummel kickin' our seats last night at the 7pm class!
